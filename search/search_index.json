This\nbook will give you some fantastic background on the whole Chaos Engineering\ndiscipline, and it\u2019s free!  Chaos Engineering is a discipline that allows you to surface weaknesses, and\neventually build confidence, in complex and often distributed systems.   The Chaos Toolkit aims to give you the simplest experience for writing and\nrunning your own Chaos Engineering experiments. The main concepts are all\nexpressed in an experiment definition, of which the following is an example\nfrom the Chaos Toolkit Samples \nproject:  { \n     \"version\" :   \"1.0.0\" , \n     \"title\" :   \"System is resilient to provider's failures\" , \n     \"description\" :   \"Can our consumer survive gracefully a provider's failure?\" , \n     \"tags\" :   [ \n         \"service\" , \n         \"kubernetes\" , \n         \"spring\" \n     ], \n     \"steady-state-hypothesis\" :   { \n         \"title\" :   \"Services are all available and healthy\" , \n         \"probes\" :   [ \n             { \n                 \"type\" :   \"probe\" , \n                 \"name\" :   \"all-services-are-healthy\" , \n                 \"tolerance\" :   true , \n                 \"provider\" :   { \n                     \"type\" :   \"python\" , \n                     \"module\" :   \"chaosk8s.probes\" , \n                     \"func\" :   \"all_microservices_healthy\" \n                 } \n             } \n         ] \n     }, \n     \"method\" :   [ \n         { \n             \"type\" :   \"action\" , \n             \"name\" :   \"stop-provider-service\" , \n             \"provider\" :   { \n                 \"type\" :   \"python\" , \n                 \"module\" :   \"chaosk8s.actions\" , \n                 \"func\" :   \"kill_microservice\" , \n                 \"arguments\" :   { \n                     \"name\" :   \"my-provider-service\" \n                 } \n             }, \n             \"pauses\" :   { \n                 \"after\" :   10 \n             } \n         }, \n         { \n             \"ref\" :   \"all-services-are-healthy\" \n         }, \n         { \n             \"type\" :   \"probe\" , \n             \"name\" :   \"consumer-service-must-still-respond\" , \n             \"provider\" :   { \n                 \"type\" :   \"http\" , \n                 \"url\" :   \"http://192.168.42.58:31018/invokeConsumedService\" \n             } \n         } \n     ], \n     \"rollbacks\" :   []  }   The key concepts of the Chaos Toolkit are  Experiments , Steady State Hypothesis  and the experiment\u2019s  Method .

However, it appears certain concepts are settling down\nenough to start agreeing on a shared understanding.\n\n\nThis specification is not prescriptive and does not aim at forcing the\ncommunity into one direction, rather it strives at providing a common\nvocabulary that new practicionners can easily make sense of.\n\n\nIt is necessary to appreciate that this document does not specify what tools,\nsuch as the Chaos Monkey or similar, should look like.
