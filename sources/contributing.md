The Chaos Toolkit is a free and open source tool _and_ a 
community-driven [set of projects](https://github.com/chaostoolkit). The 
community's input is what makes this project special and a success. 

Your input could take the form of ***raising issues***, ***voting for issues***, 
***starring projects***, ***joining us on our [community Slack team](https://join.chaostoolkit.org/)***, ***submitting pull requests***, or even ***suggesting whole new extension projects***. 

Whatever you can contribute, ***we're listening and want you to help us drive the 
project forward***.

## The Chaos Toolkit Incubator

New potential projects should be first incubated in the 
[Chaos Toolkit Incubator](https://github.com/chaostoolkit-incubator) until they 
are ready to be moved into the main 
[Chaos Toolkit suite of projects](https://github.com/chaostoolkit). 
Conditions for graduating a project from the Incubator to the main suite of 
projects include:

* ***Correct Licensing and Certification of Origin.***
* ***A popular starred and used extension to the Chaos Toolkit.***
* ***Active and prompt project issue resolution.***
