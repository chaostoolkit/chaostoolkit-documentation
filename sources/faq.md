## What is the Chaos Toolkit?

It is an open-source software that runs an experiment against your system to
confirm or infirm an hypothesis. Colloquially this refers to the 
C[haos Engineering Principles][principles].

## Why do I need to run experiments?

Systems do not live in a vacuum, they are subjected to real world events, some
expected and tolerated, others considered as attacks. Waiting for those
conditions arise does not give the time your team needs to handle, learn and
adapt to the situation at hand.

In many countries, fire alarm tests are conducted at random in offices so 
people learn how to react well for the benefit of everyone. Software systems
should go through the same exercises. The Chaos Toolkit hopes to make it 
simple and safe to run experiments like these.

## Engaging the team and organisation

Chaos engineering aims at making you learn from your system. This is not a lone
activity but a team, potentially the whole organisation, endeavor.

Indeed, a hypothesis you could set the hypothesis "we have been hacked and lost
users sensitive data, we should issue a statement we are doing everything to
fix the problem within 15min". This experiment is not really technical but
organisational: is the chain of information and command working effectively?

## Isn't it testing?

We do not consider testing and chaos engineering to conflict with each other.
They both provide useful and actionable feedback. Where they differ is their
objective. 

Testing is a process that aims at telling you if your application,
within controlled boundaries, runs as expected. 

Chaos engineering is a discipline of posing a hypothesis before collecting
evidence to reject or accept that hypothesis.

A test is sort of an hypothesis in its own. The difference lies in the
experimental approach of the chaos engineering discipline. It asks a question and
then observe the system to see if we can answer that question positively or
negatively.

Incidentally, some forms of testing are not too dissimilar to a chaos engineering
experiment. Say for instance, you run a load testing. Your hypothesis is that
response time should not be impacted under load. By running your experiment,
you may answer that question.

## Isn't it monitoring?

Much like chaos engineering is not testing, it should not be conflated with
monitoring. If anything, chaos engineering strives for good monitoring for it
helps observing the system during the experiment.

Monitoring surfaces, informs and may even react to conditions in your system.
But this is not answering a question like chaos engineering tries to do.

##Â Why a toolkit?

Currently, running experiments is not an easy task because the ecosystem is 
still fairly young. Complex cases have been demonstrated at large corporations
such as Netflix or LinkedIn. Tools such as [ChAP][chap] or [Simoorg][simoorg]
are powerful but quite involved.

The Chaos Toolkit aims at providing a more straightforward initial user
experience to gain confidence in doing Chaos Engineering experiments. The
simpler it gets the greater our cognitive capacity to understand what is going
on.

Ultimately, the Chaos Toolkit should lead you on the path to using richer tools
such as those cited above.

## What does the Chaos Toolkit do?

The Chaos Toolkit user-interface is a command line that takes a JSON-encoded
file describing the experiment to run. It consists of a sequence of activities
the toolkit executes in order to produce a final report. 

The activities are of two kinds. Probes observe the system at various point of
the experiment. Actions interact with the system to change its state. Usually
the action represents the hypothesis you are trying to learn from.

## Who is behind the Chaos Toolkit?

The effort was initiated by [Russ Miles][russ] and
[Sylvain Hellegouarch][sylvain], two engineers passionate about fluidity in
complex systems. However, their vision is really to build a
[strong community][community] of engineer experiences to feedback
into the Chaos Toolkit.
