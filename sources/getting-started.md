The best way to quickly explore using the Chaos Toolkit is to work through the [Getting Started section of our free online tutorials][getting-started-tutorials], available thanks to the excellent [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) system. 

These [Getting Started tutorials][getting-started-tutorials] show you how to install the Chaos Toolkit and how to use the [Chaos Toolkit's Workflow](reference/workflow.md) to `discover` and `init` to bootstrap your own experiments, so that you can then `run` them in order to produce a `report` that you and your teams can learn from as you aim to improve your system.
