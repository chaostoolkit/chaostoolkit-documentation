# Welcome to the Chaos Toolkit!

***The Chaos Toolkit Workflow: [`discover`](reference/usage/discover.md) -> 
[`init`](reference/usage/init.md) -> [`run`](reference/usage/run.md) -> 
[`report`](reference/usage/report.md)***

The Chaos Toolkit aims to be the simplest and easiest way to explore building 
your own [Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/) Experiments. It 
also aims to define a vendor and technology independent way of specifying 
Chaos Engineering experiments by providing an 
[Open API](reference/api/experiment.md).

The Chaos Toolkit provides a [CLI](reference/usage/cli.md) that can be used 
to execute the [`discover`](reference/usage/discover.md) -> 
[`init`](reference/usage/init.md) -> [`run`](reference/usage/run.md) -> 
[`report`](reference/usage/report.md) 
[Chaos Engineering workflow](reference/workflow.md).
