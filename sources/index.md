# Chaos Engineering Experiments Automation

The Chaos Toolkit aims to be the simplest and easiest way to explore building 
your own [Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/) Experiments. It 
also aims to define a vendor and technology independent way of specifying 
Chaos Engineering experiments by providing an 
[Open API](reference/api/experiment.md).

We suggest you start with the [tutorials](reference/tutorial) to get a feel for how the Chaos
Toolkit can help you automate your Chaos Engineering effort. Once you are ready
for your own experiments, have a look at the various [driver extensions][drivers]
we support, which ranges from platforms to cloud providers while giving you
tools to observe your system as you run your experiments.

Finally, if you came to [contribute](reference/contributing), you are more than welcome. Start with
[joining the community][slack] and read our references like the Open API
which specifies the Chaos Toolkit experiment format.

Above all, have fun!
