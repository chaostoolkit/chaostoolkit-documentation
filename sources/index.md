# An Open API for Chaos Engineering

The Chaos Toolkit is a free, open source project that enables you to create and
apply Chaos Experiments to various types of infrastructure, platforms and
applications.

Running experiments is as simple as:

```sh
$ chaos run an-experiment.json
```

This takes the description of your experiment, runs it and outputs a report
to share with your team.

## Mission

The Chaos Toolkit aims at simplifying your journey through the
[Principles of Chaos Engineering][principles] and more generally considers that
you should embrace continuously observing and poking your system to empower your
team in face of adversity.

The Chaos Toolkit proposes an Open API for Chaos Engineering that will federate
communities around the discipline with a standard, open and evolutive API.

## Come join the Chaos Toolkit community

The Chaos Toolkit is an [open source project][oss] and strives on a diverse and
cooperative community. We welcome input and discussions on the project itself
but also on the [Principles of Chaos Engineering][principles] in general.

Please [join us][join]!
