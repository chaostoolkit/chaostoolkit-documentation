# Chaos Engeering Concepts in the Chaos Toolkit

If you haven't already, we strongly recommend reading the fantastic
[Chaos Engineering][chaos-engingeering-book] book from O'Reilly Media. This
book will give you some fantastic background on the whole Chaos Engineering
discipline, and it's free!

Chaos Engineering is a discipline that allows you to surface weaknesses, and
eventually build confidence, in complex and often distributed systems. 

The Chaos Toolkit aims to give you the simplest experience for writing and
running your own Chaos Engineering experiments. The main concepts are all
expressed in an experiment definition, of which the following is an example
from the
[Chaos Toolkit Samples](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-samples)
project:

    ],

}
```

The key concepts of the Chaos Toolkit are `Experiments`,
`Steady State Hypothesis` and the experiment's `Method`. The `Method`
contains a combination of `Probes` and `Actions`.

## Experiments

A Chaos Toolkit experiment is provided in a single file and is currently
expressed in JSON.

## Steady State Hypothesis

A Steady State Hypothesis describes "what normal looks like" for your system
in order for the experiment to surface information about weaknesses when compared against the declared "normal" tolerances of what is measured.

The Chaos Toolkit uses the Steady State Hypothesis for two purposes. It is used as a check before an experiment is run that the target system is in a recognised ***normal*** state. It is also used as the template for comparison of the state of your system ***after*** the experiment has been run, forming the results provided by the experiment's report.

## Method

An experiment's activities are contained within its `Method` block.

## Probes

A probe is a way of observing a particular set of conditions in the system that
is undergoing experimentation.

## Actions

An action is a particular activity that needs to be enacted on the system under
experimentation.

## Rollbacks

An experiment may define a sequence of actions that revert what was undone
during the experiment.
