# Key Project Values

The following key values of the Chaos Toolkit reflect the mindset the community
has when engineering the Chaos Toolkit project.

## Simplicity

The Chaos Toolkit aims at being a simple piece of technology both from a user
and developer perspective.

To achieve simplicity, the Chaos Toolkit comes as a command line interface
driven by a description file. As a user, this means no code and no need to 
learn a programming language. As a developer, this reduces the functional
surface area to consider.

## Extensibility

The Chaos Toolkit does not wish to be a monolith and strives to be extended to
fully reach its goal through community driven efforts.

By using a description file, the implementation is not prescribed by the Chaos
Toolkit project. Although we fully expect the community to eventually settle on
certain implementations of probes and actions.

## Readability

We believe code readability is a factor for positive maintenance and evolutivity.

Readable code never goes out of fashion. As the code of the Chaos Toolkit is
mostly written in Python, best practices such as defined in [PEP8][pep8].

## Diversity

Although not strictly speaking referring to the technological aspect of the 
project, having diversity in the community will contribute to a better project
overall.
