The heart of the Chaos Toolkit is the `chaos` command line.

!!! note "Activate the Python virtual environment"

    If you run the Chaos Toolkit directly, rather than using a container,
    always ensure you have activated the virtual environment so that it can
    be found along its dependencies:

    ```
    $ source ~/.venvs/chaostk/bin/activate
    (chaostk) $
    ```

Once [installed](install.md), the Chaos Toolkit CLI will display the commands it supports 
by executing:

```
(chaostk) $ chaos --help
```
