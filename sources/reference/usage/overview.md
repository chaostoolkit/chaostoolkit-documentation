The Chaos Toolkit implements a specific workflow that intends to help you discover, explore, build, run and , most importantly, learn from your chaos engineering experiments.

* [Install](install.md) or [Upgrade](upgrade.md) the Chaos Toolkit.
* [Discover](discover.md) what can be explored in your target environment.
* [Init](init.md) to bootstrap your own, new chaos engineering experiments based on what has been [discovered](discover.md).
* [Run](run.md) your chaos engineering experiments.
* [Produce great reports](report.md) based on the findings of your chaos engineering experiments.
* [Notify your team](notification.md) to make your experiments visible to all.
