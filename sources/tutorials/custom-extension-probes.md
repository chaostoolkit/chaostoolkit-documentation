# Create a new Chaos Toolkit Extension with Custom Probes

The Chaos Toolkit can be extended to observe specific information about your system, using probes, as well as provide custom actions that can be used from within your experiment's method. 

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a new custom Python extension to the Chaos Toolkit to expose some custom probes in order to gather more data from the observability of your system. This is done so that you can customize how you specify your Steady State Hypothesis as well as providing a custom means of gathering additional data during your experiment execution.

!!! note
    The next tutorial in this series will show how to construct custom actions as well so that those can be used within your Chaos experiment's method.
